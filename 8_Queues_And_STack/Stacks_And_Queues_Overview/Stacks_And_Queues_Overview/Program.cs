                - Stacks and Queues are data structures.
                - A data structure in computer science is a data organization, management and storage format
                  that enables efficient access and manipulations of the data.
                - Each data structure has its unique way of storing and managing data


                    STACK : operates on the principle of LIFO (Last In First Out). Meaning:
                - Data can be added/Removed from the top
                - Can't access the element in the middle
                - First come last out or last in first out (LIFO)
                - Often used in mathematical algorithms and data management

                    Best used cases for Stack:
                1) Reversing data
                2) Web browser back button
                3) Undo and redo buttons

                    Stack Operations
                1) Push(object obj) //add data
                2) Pop() //remove data
                3) Object Peek() //returns object at the top of the stack


                    Queues : operates in the principle of FIFO (First In First Out). Meaning:
                1) Data can be added only from the back and retrieved from the front
                2) Can't access the element in the middle.
                3) First in First Out (FIFO) system
                4) They can be executed in the order they came in (i.e first come first served)

                    Best used cases for Queues:
                1) Operating system (OS) IO requests
                2) Mouse movement
                3) Managing mouse request in a server //to handle them one after the other
                4) Queuing input in video games

                   Queue Operations
                1) Enqueue(object obj) //add data to the back of the queue
                2) object Dequeue() //remove data from the front
                3) Object Peek() //returns object in the from of the queue
